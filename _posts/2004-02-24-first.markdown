Blog.Thoughtwax is has been put together for a number of reasons.





Primarily, it's an area to post general thoughts and links to items of interest. Secondly, it's going to serve as an overflow area where I can present small items that don't merit being put on the [main site](http://www.thoughtwax.com/), and also present works in progress. Also, I've got a defective memory, so here's where I can record a coherent line of thought. Mostly it's to try to encourage myself to get more done.





If you find any browser bugs or have any feedback, [let me know](mailto:emmet.connolly@gmail.com). I'm hoping to add a comments system in the near future.
