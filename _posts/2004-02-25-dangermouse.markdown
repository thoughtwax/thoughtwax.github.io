title: The Grey Album
---

Dj Dangermouse has put together The Grey Album using only vocals from Jay-Z's Black Album and music from The Beatles' White Album. He has done an amazing job of putting a contemporary slant on 30 year old music, and the Grey album sounds fantastic. If you're a Beatles fan it's also a lot of fun to play spot the tune, as most tracks feature more than one song. Among the best music I've heard this year.
