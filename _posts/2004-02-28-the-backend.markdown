title: The Backend

Finished the backend.





It's built in ASP with an Access 2000 database storing the content. The entire site runs off a single file. There's another file for content management, which allows me to add and edit entries, and manage the comments system. Comments have been enabled retrospectively.





The front end of the site is built with valid [XHTML](http://validator.w3.org/check/referer) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer), so that means no markup for visual presentation and platform independent display.





The font used in the header is Baskerville Old Face.





And so to bed.
