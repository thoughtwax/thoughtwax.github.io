I've been experimenting with [Proce55ing](http://www.proce55ing.net/), an open source programming environment for producing visuals, developed by [Ben Fry](http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry) and [Casey Reas](http://www.groupc.net/) at the [Aesthetics + Computation Group, MIT](http://acg.media.mit.edu/).





> Processing is an environment for learning the fundamentals of computer programming within the context of the electronic arts. it is an electronic sketchbook for developing ideas.





I'll be posting some early experiments soon.
