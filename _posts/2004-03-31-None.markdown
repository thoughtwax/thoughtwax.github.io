title: Photo Mapping and Information Visualization
---

Seems a lot of attention has being paid to **information visualisation using maps** recently, such as projects like [GeoURL](http://geourl.org/) and [Zipdecode](http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/). Overlaying geographic data onto a map is interesting, but I also like it when this geographic data is combined with local photography to produce a map of an area that can be viewed at different scales through photos of each section.







  * [Seamless City](http://www.seamlesscity.com/s1.html) - creates a small scale photo map, stitched together house by house


  * [NYC in pictures](http://www.didik.com/nycinpictures/) - is a block by block photo representation of New York's streets


  * [Degree Confluence Project](http://www.confluence.org/) - photo mapping the entire globe according to GPS ([link credit](http://www.mle.ie/~jonah/blog/index.php?p=123&c=1))





Similarly, [RAW](http://www.medialabeurope.org/hc/raw/) uses photos to create a timeline based map, and [Cinema Redux](http://www.brendandawes.com/sketches/redux/) uses photos to create a map of a movie. The notion of a map as a plan of physical space is expanded upon. In a way, I suppose all data visualisation is mapamaking.





Lots more interesting stuff going on at the course page for [Information Visualization as Artistic Practice](http://courses.cfa.cmu.edu/%7Ep5admin/infovis/2004s/), taught by [Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com/).





**Update:** More photo mapping of a city, London this time, in [Street Sensation](http://www.streetsensation.co.uk/).
