[Vectorial Elevation](http://www3.alzado.net/edublinpress.html) is a public art experiment taking place in Dublin soon.




> As of April 22, 2004, anyone who logs onto the website [www.dublinelevation.net](http://www.dublinelevation.net) will be able to design enormous light sculptures in the sky of Dublin. The website will have a 3D virtual model of the city where participants can make a light design using 22 robotic searchlights placed around O?Connell Street. As submissions arrive from the Internet, every fifteen seconds a new pattern will be displayed in the sky.




**Update:** This made the front cover of the [Irish Times](http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/front/2004/0423/index.html)
