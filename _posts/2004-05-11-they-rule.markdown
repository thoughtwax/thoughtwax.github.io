title: They Rule
---

An updated version of [They Rule](http://www.theyrule.net/), an online project similar to the work of [Mark Lombardi](http://www.pierogi2000.com/flatfile/lombardi.html), is live. There's an intersting program on Lombardi at [NPR](http://www.npr.org/display_pages/features/feature_1487185.html).





Reminds me of the back cover of [Yanqui U.X.O.](http://www.cstrecords.com/html/uxo.html)
