[One Block Radius](http://www.oneblockradius.org/obr.html) is a New York based project that maps a single block of the city, and invites contributors to add personally collected data to the map, creating "an extensive psychogeographic survey" of the area.





Photos, sounds, text and video of a place or object are added to the map, documenting human-scale details and personal experiences of the area.
