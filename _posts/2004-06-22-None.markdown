[Street Memes](http://www.streetmemes.com/), tracking the spread of street art.




> "street meme": a sticker, stencil, or poster that can spread a single image around the world. Unlike traditional graffiti art where each piece is unique, street memes can be copied repeatedly, taking on a life of their own, and spreading through the collective effort of people scattered around the world.




Richard Dawkins coined the term [meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) in his book [_The Selfish Gene_](http://www.rubinghscience.org/memetics/dawkinsmemes.html), basically defining a meme as the viral spread of an idea among people. [The Memespread Project](http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,63344,00.html) attempted to track the forced spread of a meme online.
