title: GPS Photo Mapping and Drawing
---

GPS photo mapping projects at [Tokyo Picturesque](http://www.downgoesthesystem.com/devzone/exiftest/final/) and [Perspectives](http://www.marumushi.com/apps/perspectives/) ([more](http://marcosweskamp.marumushi.com/))




[GPS Drawing](http://www.gpsdrawing.com/): this reminds me of the letter-drawing walks Stillman takes in a short story I just read, _City of Glass_ by Paul Auster.
