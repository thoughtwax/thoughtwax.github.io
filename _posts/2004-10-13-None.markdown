[The Insecurities Project](http://www.insecuritiesproject.com/)




> In airports around the world, security personnel are now asking many travellers to take a photo to prove their camera is not a bomb... Devos is collecting these photographs for an international art project. While there have been many changes in our sense of security, this one may be the only one that is being documented; a record being produced by travellers on their journey.
