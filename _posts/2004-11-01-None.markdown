title: Creative Response to Cease-and-Desist
---

Following on from the previous post, here's an [interesting response](http://textz.com/trash/readme.txt) to being served with a cease-and-desist order by the copyright holder of a book's lawyers that you're not even hosting: provide a [PHP script](http://textz.com/trash/walser.php.txt) that decodes an encrypted version of the book that may only be run with the expressed permission of the lawyers themselves.
