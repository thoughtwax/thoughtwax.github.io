> We should go forth on the shortest walk, perchance, in the spirit of undying adventure, never to return, --prepared to send back our embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms. If you are ready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife and child and friends, and never see them again, --if you have paid your debts, and made your will, and settled all your affairs, and are a free man, then you are ready for a walk.




- Henry David Thoreau, [Walking](http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/AmericanStudies/faculty/schuyler/schuyler_amlandscape/walking.html)
