In the wake of [some](http://realtime.waag.org/) [similar](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) [initiatives](http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/LondonFreeMap), the first stirrings of an Irish free and open source mapping project has emerged in the form of [OpenEir](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2005/04/openeir_the_ope.html). It would be great to see this become a successful community project.





OpenEir routes are being created using [MyGPS](http://www.faureragani.it/mygps/indexeng.html) on [WorldKit MapProxy](http://brainoff.com/worldkit/mapproxy/) satellite photos.
