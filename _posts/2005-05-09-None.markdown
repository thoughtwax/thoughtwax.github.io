title: Locative Media as Narrative
---

> If we produce a work of art that is based on data aqcuired from a locative device such as GPS, Bluetooth or WiFi the fact that it tells a story of some sort, is a given. It's inherent. To produce the data, the device would have to physically move from point A to B to C etc... the fact that it describes a story is unavoidable.
  
  

If I'm made aware of the fact that this is a GPS tracklog, I know that there must be some form of narrative regardless of whether or not I'm actually able to read any of it. This is one of the most important aspects of locative media as an art medium. Regardless of how we choose to present it, it's always a record of a sequence of events. A story.
