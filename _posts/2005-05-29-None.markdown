> 
Goodbye, you had to say to every room  

When as a child you went out.  

Those rooms might not be there when you returned.  

Even now, when you've been out,  

You like to creep back and stare through your windows  

As if to catch the rooms by surprise,  

To see what they look like in your absence  

Or to snatch a glimpse of yourself.  

The house a mirror which might make that self seem true.
