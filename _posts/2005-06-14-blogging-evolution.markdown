title: Blogging Style Evolution
---

Looking over the archives here, I've noticed the style of posts has changed quite a bit over time. As you can see from the last few posts, I seem to be quoting quite a bit. Back in [September 2004](/?a=1&y=2004&m=9), for example, it was all about one line links to interesting sites, and lots of them. Recently, the posts have been a bit longer, but less frequent.




This is partly due to the fact that I now use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/thoughtwax) to to publicly bookmark, so those single link posts are all but gone. (I've also been posting photos to [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/thoughtwax).) It's probably also a reflection of the flurry of aimless research that marked the start of my Masters studies, whereas I am a little more focused now. Unfortunately, I don't do enough actual _writing_ here to [improve](http://kevindunne.com/) all that much.




Anyway, at this rate, expect an essay every month for the next year, and a thesis every year after that.
