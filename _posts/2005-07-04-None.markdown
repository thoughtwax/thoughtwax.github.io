A friend asked me what _LAMP_ in the previous post means. It stands for Linux/Apache/MySql/PHP -- a robust and stable collection of Open Source programs used for web development.




I checked out the entry for [LAMP on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP), and noticed that a Microsoft Windows/Microsoft IIS/Mysql/PHP developing environment is, of course, known as... _WIMP_.
