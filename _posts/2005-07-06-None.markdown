In a piece of good news, the [EU Patents Directive](http://noepatents.eu.org/index.php/NO_Software_Patents) was overturned by a large majority this morning in the European Parliament. One of the speakers in the [Exploiting Potential](http://www.submerge.org.uk/exploitingpotential/) symposium last week discussed this issue at length, and a couple of days ago I emailed the Irish MEPs to express my opposition to the proposal.





I actually heard the news this morning from none other that Dublin MEP [Gay Mitchell](http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/whos_mep.data?ipid=0&ilg=EN&iucd=28112&ipolgrp=.&ictry=IE&itempl=&ireturn=&imode=), who emailed me back:




> Thank you for your recent email.  The European Parliament this morning voted to reject the draft directive on computer-implemented inventions.  It does not seem likely that the Commission will bring forward an alternative in the near future. A consensus seems to have evolved in the Parliament that no directive is better than a bad directive.





Seems like Gay was on the same page as [Associated Press](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8B5SRJG0.htm?campaign_id=apn_tech_down):




> "It was a mess. Better no directive than a bad directive," said Tony Robinson, spokesman for the Socialist group in parliament.





Still, good for him for emailing back.
