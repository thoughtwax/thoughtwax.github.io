"_We know that, in the course of fl√¢nerie, far-off times and places interpenetrate the landscape and the present moment._"
- Walter Benjamin ([more](http://www.yorku.ca/fes/research_pub/pubs/pdf/Alexandre_Ouimet.pdf))

"_Unitary Urbanism: The theory of the combined use of art and technology leading to the integrated construction of  an environment dynamically linked to behavioural experiments._"
- Internationale Situationniste #1, June 1958 ([more](http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html))

"_The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance which is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the ground); the appealing or repelling character of certain places - all this seems to be neglected._"
- Guy Debord, Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography ([more](http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2))

"_Live without dead time._"
- Graffiti, Paris, May 1968 ([more](http://dialogues.rutgers.edu/vol_01/pdf_files/e_aronow.pdf))
