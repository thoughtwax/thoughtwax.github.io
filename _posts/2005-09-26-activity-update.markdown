Time for an update on what has been keeping me busy recently, and plans for what's next...

I went back to Plymouth last week to begin the second year of my Masters studies. Met up with some great, interesting people that I'll be working with this year, and was really enthused by talking to them. I've got lots of ideas and thoughts for what might come next. Stay tuned at my [research website](http://x2.i-dat.org/~ec).

I've also been working on a collaberative mapping project with a designer from Cornwall. On Friday I trained it down there are we mapped the perimeter of a lake using a GPS unit ([photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/theirwork/sets/1022073/)). I'll post more on this as the project matures, and you can follow along at home on the project [blog](http://theirwork.org/blog/) and [wiki](http://theirwork.org/wiki/).
