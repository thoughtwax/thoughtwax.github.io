On Saturday I went to TechCamp, a free self-organising technology conference that was run by the attendees. The guiding rule was that everyone who attended should present some work or contribute in some way. There was a room for moderated open discussions, and a room for presentations, so people floated between them as they wished. I got to chat with lots of nice and interesting geeks, and there's already been talk of organising a follow up session. TechCamp Galway, anyone?

I spoke about how principles of Adaptive Design can be applied to software development - my slides are [online](http://thoughtwax.com/sandbox/TechCamp/), and can be [downloaded](http://thoughtwax.com/sandbox/TechCamp/AdaptiveDesign.zip).
