Dom came over for the weekend, and brought me a present - a [lovely book](http://flickr.com/photos/thoughtwax/58156226/) called _Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers_. From the back cover:



> Wabi-sabi is _the_ quintessentail Japanese aesthetic. It is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent and incomplete. It is a beauty of things modest and humble. It is a beauty of things unconventional...



Interestingly, I first came across the term in the source code of [some wiki software](http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/WabiSabi) (explaining that wikis are very wabi-sabi), and it is by no means a stretch of the imagination to apply the ideas to software, agile development and adaptive design.

I've been getting into the ideas behind Japanese architecture a bit recently too, so it should be a treat - looking forward to the read ahead. Thanks Dom!
