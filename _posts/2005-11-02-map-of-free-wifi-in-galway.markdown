I'm moving house this weekend, and it might take a couple of weeks to get broadband set up in the new place. In the meantime, I'll be relying on the kindness of strangers. Couldn't find anything like this online, so I put together a [map of free WiFi hotspots in Galway](http://thoughtwax.com/sandbox/galway-wifi/).

It's a bit sparse at the moment - send me an email or leave a comment if you know of any more that should be included.

**Update:** I've added a couple more suggested points to the map.

[James Corbett](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2005/11/mapping_and_ind.html) has come up with the idea of combining a number of feeds like this to create an [Open Irish Directory](http://kbcafe.com/rss/opmlsurfer.aspx?q=http%3A%2F%2Feirepreneur.blogs.com%2Feirepreneur%2FIrelandDirectory.opml) of hotspots and other amenities. If you're interested in helping out by providing some data about your local area (which requires almost no technical expertise), contact James.

**Oops:** Should be working ok in Internet Explorer now.
