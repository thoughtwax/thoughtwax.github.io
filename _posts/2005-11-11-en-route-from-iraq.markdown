While waiting for a flight in Shannon airport on Wednesday I met some American soldiers who were on their way home after thirteen months in Iraq.

As far as I know (and according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Airport#Foreign_military_aircraft_at_Shannon)), soldiers using the airport are not supposed to mingle with the public, but my flight had been delayed by three hours. I was wandering in the almost-empty departures lounge when [they all poured in](http://flickr.com/photos/thoughtwax/62127698/).

I spoke with [one guy](http://flickr.com/photos/thoughtwax/62127805/) for a while before having to leave to catch my flight.
