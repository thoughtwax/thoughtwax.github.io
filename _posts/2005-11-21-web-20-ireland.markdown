I'm now also blogging on [Web2.0ireland.com](http://web2.0ireland.com/), along with [James](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/). We're going to be covering all issues around the Web 2.0 scene in Ireland, with a focus on new startups and projects in Ireland, the growth of the industry here, and how international developments are affecting us at home.



> Web2.0ireland exists to record and encourage the develoment of the latest and most exciting happenings and products in the Irish Web 2.0 scene.



James has started things off with a post on [Nooked](http://web2.0ireland.com/2005/11/20/nooked-feedwizard/).

We're not entirely sure what we're going to achieve with this (if anything), but it looks like there are enough people here doing interesting things with technology to start a discussion.
