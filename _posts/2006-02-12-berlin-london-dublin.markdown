I'm home from a fun and full week away. There was Berlin and the [Transmediale](http://www.transmediale.de/) festival (including a talk by Janet Cardiff), [Dorkbot](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotbln/), snowball fights, and cheap beer. Then there was London and the [Web 2.0 Summit](http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/), being blown away by [Tino Sehgal at the ICA](http://www.ica.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=14698), [Prefabulous London](http://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/exhibitions_prefab.php), and expensive beer. And last night there was Dublin for a [two and a half hour set](http://www.nialler9.com/blog/?p=22) from Broken Social Scene.

Links are the new holiday snaps.
