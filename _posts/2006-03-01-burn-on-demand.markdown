Does anyone know of a "burn on demand" service - that is, something that allows you to order small runs of CDs to be professionally burned (not as CDRs) and packaged as needed?

[Neassa](http://www.myspace.com/poltergeistrec) told me about the difficulty of getting a relatively small print run of her EP done. Services like [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/) allow authors to self-publish single copies of their book as they are needed. Why not CDs? I asked a friend who works for a label, who asked his boss, and both came back negative - they'd never heard of it.

I've wondered if there would be any point to something like this. Not the mechanics of it - asking a musician to manually create the CDs themself would be the equivalent of asking an author to photocopy their book for distribution - but the obsolescence of the format itself. What with the new model for music distribution - iTunes, MySpace, the Arctic Monkeys and all that - where does the humble CD stand?

As an aside, one of my favourite projects from Transmediale was [Burnstation](http://www.burnstation.org/), a mobile copying station loaded with Copyleft licenced music. You browse for music you dig, then burn it all to a CD to take with you.

Anyway, burn on demand, does it exist? Should it?
