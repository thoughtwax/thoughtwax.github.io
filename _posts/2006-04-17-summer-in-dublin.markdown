Life rumbles on, even if this blog lies fallow. I live in Dublin now, and do all the Dubliney things that it entails; reading on the Dart to work in the morning, meeting up with old friends in the evenings, going to some exhibitions with Paula, driving home to Galway the odd weekend.

And the evenings are getting bright. Shadows stretch long along the ground and crawl up onto buildings, the sky is getting blue, and the low hanging sun glares on the road; time to get the camera out again, the photographic light has arrived.
