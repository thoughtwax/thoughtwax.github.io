The good news is that comments are working on this site again, having been laid to ruins by comment spammers. It looks like the database simply decided it had seen enough and sat down, and to be honest I can't blame it.

Unfortunately in the restore I lost the last four months or so of comments. Apologies to everyone who had something great to say here since February, and I promise to back up more often from now on.
