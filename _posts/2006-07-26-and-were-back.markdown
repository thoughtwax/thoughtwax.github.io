Despite what the internet seems to be trying to suggest, I'm going to keep not taking the hint and carry on here.

Following swiftly on from The Great Comment Spam Siege of last month, there was a week in the dark here due to domain name problems.

All's well now, but stay tuned, as I may well break the entire internet before winter.
