Back from a weekend of proudly introducing some colleagues to the joys of the west of Ireland. At one stage, I noticed that many conversations I have these days about cultural stuff seem to end with me saying, "I'll send you a link". As in, have you seen the trailer for the new Michel Gondry film? Oh, it looks good, [I'll send you a link](http://www.apple.com/trailers/warner_independent_pictures/thescienceofsleep/).

Here are the links that I promised to send over the weekend (that I can remember, there may be more):

[Andy Goldsworthy videos on YouTube](http://youtube.com/results?search_query=andy+goldsworthy)
[McSweeney's](http://mcsweeneys.net/)
[The Onion on Wikipedia](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902)
Articles about Wikipedia's [faults](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/10/the_amorality_o.php) and it's [contributor breakdown](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)

A result, I suppose, of spending more time online and less time on traditional media, a habit whose progress continues unabated. At least now I can just point them to this blog post instead.
