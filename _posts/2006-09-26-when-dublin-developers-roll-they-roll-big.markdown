In more Dublin urban development news, this is quite odd: [Dublin Coastal Development](http://dublincoastaldevelopment.com/), "a new vision for Dublin". I must embarrassingly admit that I was a couple of minutes into the video before the penny dropped.



It's very slickly produced, sporting just the right amount of cheesiness. It also touches enough contemporary points to be almost believeable; Dublin's unstoppable urban sprawl and tremendously stupid developments given the green light thanks to planning corruption have resulted in worse travesties than this.

(On a meta note, that's the first time I've embedded a YouTube in my site, and I found myself wondering if I wanted to, you know, take my blog in that direction _stylistically_. Until I caught myself. Does anyone else have these delusions of grandeur about their blog without even realising it?)
