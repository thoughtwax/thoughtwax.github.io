I went to Vienna for the long weekend with [Paula](http://www.paulahenihan.com/) and [Margarida](http://www.margaridapalma.com/). We flew into Bratislava (how very Ryanair to drop you in the next country and expect you to bus it from there). The journey through Slovakia was very odd; dull concrete communist hangover highrises on one side, tall forests on the other. Reprocessing plants and billboards on the horizon. Then onto a wide raised motorway, curving right over miles of corn fields before arriving at the border checkpoint, right in the middle of a massive wind farm. A couple of miles into Austria and the landscape couldn't be more different; winding roads through small hamlet towns lined by squat homes. Apparrently the marked difference was planned by the Austrians to encourage commuting city workers to live on their more expensive side of the border.
