Not a year-end list, but here's what I read since [the last time](http://blog.thoughtwax.com/?p=194):




[The Areas of my Expertise](http://www.amazon.com/Areas-My-Expertise-John-Hodgman/dp/1594482225/) by John Hodgman
Worthy toilet fodder.

[Space: Japanese Design Solutions](http://www.amazon.com/Space-Japanese-Solutions-Michael-Freeman/dp/0789310651/) by Michael Freeman
Many empty rooms.

[Penguin by Design: A Cover Story 1935-2005](http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Design-Cover-Story-1935-2005/dp/0141024232/) by Phil Baines
Many design classics.

[So Many Ways to Begin](http://www.amazon.com/So-Many-Ways-Begin-Novel/dp/1596912227) by Jon McGregor
Quiet, beautifully observed.

[Watchmen](http://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Alan-Moore/dp/0930289234/) by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons
This was great.

[Ways of Seeing](http://www.amazon.com/Ways-Seeing-Based-BBC-Television/dp/0140135154) by John Berger
A worthy re-read.

[How We Are Hungry](http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Are-Hungry-Stories/dp/1932416137) by Dave Eggers
Current favourite writer.

[Norwegian Wood](http://www.amazon.com/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375704027) by Haruki Murakami
I was disappointed.

[Kitchen Confidential](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Adventures-Culinary-Underbelly/dp/0060934913) by Anthony Bourdain
Tasty morsel (groan).

[On Photography](http://www.amazon.com/Photography-Susan-Sontag/dp/0312420099/) by Susan Sontag
Aged but insightful.


[Ham on Rye](http://www.amazon.com/Ham-Rye-Charles-Bukowski/dp/0876855575) by Charles Bukowski.
Hard, relentlessly hard.
