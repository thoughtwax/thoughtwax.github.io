While filling out [this form](https://www.quinn-secure.com/QMP/publicviewclient.do?productcode=HHD) I had a hard time finding an entry in the 'Occupation' select box to match what I do. You can tell that the list comes from some dusty old insurance almanac, being almost completely devoid of any reference to more recent professions. In the end the wonderfully mechanical 'Computer Operator' was as close as I could get, conjuring up images of me pulling cranks and levers all day long at a giant steam-spewing counting machine.

I also got an insight into some of the many other ways I could be keeping the lights on, which include:
