Here's a fun thing: using blogs to re-publish old episodic content.

[Samuel Pepy's diary](http://www.pepysdiary.com/) has been published as a blog since 2003. [Bible RSS feeds](http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/share/rss2.0/) for your daily scriptures (see also [Blogging the Bible](http://www.slate.com/id/2141050/) by David Plotz on Slate). It's Bloomsday, but is reading [_Ulysses_ a page a day](http://botheration.org/ulysses/) via RSS any more manageable than the dead tree version? [Steven Wright](http://twitter.com/notstevenwright) and [Jenny Holzer](http://twitter.com/jennyholzer) are rocking opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum over on Twitter (never before, I think, has a medium been put to such perfectly apt use). Each day last February [I posted](http://blog.thoughtwax.com/2006/02/the-prophet) the 28 chapters of Kahlil Gibran's _The Prophet_.
