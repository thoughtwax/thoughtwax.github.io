I created a new Flickr group called **[Guess Where Dublin](http://www.flickr.com/groups/guess-where-dublin/)**.

The idea is totally ripped off from [many other similar groups](http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=guess+where), but I think it's a great concept. Members are encouraged to post a photo taken somewhere in Dublin and everyone else has to guess exactly where it was taken. What could be more fun?

Not entirely unrelated, I just read a beautiful little book that interested types might enjoy: [Outside Lies Magic: Regaining History and Awareness in Everyday Places](http://www.amazon.com/Outside-Lies-Magic-Regaining-Awareness/dp/0802775632) by John R. Stilgoe. It's a "guidebook to exploring" everyday places by walking or cycling, and it really is accessible and enjoyable. From the intro:



> The whole concatenation of wild and artificial things, the natural ecosystem as modified by people over the centuries, the built environment layered over layers, the eerie mix of sounds and smells and glimpses neither natural nor crafted -- all of it is free for the taking, for the taking in.



[Join the group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/guess-where-dublin/) and start exploring.
