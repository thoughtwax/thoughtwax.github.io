In September 2004 I took up a part-time Masters in [Digital Art & Technology](http://m.i-dat.org/01-Intro), and this week I submitted my final project and thesis.

The project is location-aware audio software that allows you to make field recordings while out walking, and simultaneously playback the recordings made by other people in the same area.

The thesis is titled -- wait for it -- _Adaptive Spaces: Technological Augmentation of the post-Situationist Urban Experience_. Actually I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, as I at least managed to work through some of the many random-but-somehow-related thoughts I've been having about this area over the last couple of years. If you are one of the few people who gets around to reading it, I would love to hear from you.

You can get the source code of the project and a PDF copy of the thesis at this page: **[Adaptive Spaces](http://thoughtwax.com/adaptive-spaces/)**.

Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
