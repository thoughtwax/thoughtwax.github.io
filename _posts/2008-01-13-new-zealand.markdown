Yesterday on the connecting flight home from Seoul I watched _In The Shadow of the Moon_, a documentary about the Apollo space missions. Having returned from their long journeys to a strange and wonderful place far away, after splashdown, astronauts would have to spend some time in a small isolation chamber, peering out a small window at their familiar (but now somehow different) home environment, slowly becoming accustomed to their own world again. That's sort of how I feel today.

I'm working through the decompression period by sifting through photos and [putting some online](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thoughtwax/sets/72157603708081209/). More reflections on the trip to follow, maybe.
