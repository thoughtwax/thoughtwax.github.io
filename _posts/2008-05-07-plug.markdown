Something from real life: my girlfriend Paula is having an exhibition entitled _Ties_ in the [Galway Arts Centre](http://www.galwayartscentre.ie/), 47 Dominick Street, Galway. It's going to be running from tomorrow, May 8th, to the end of the month.

Also, I finally made a [new website](http://www.paulahenihan.com/) for Paula. She has a [blog](http://www.paulahenihan.com/blog/) there now too. Hooray!
