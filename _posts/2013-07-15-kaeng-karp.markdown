You can't wear sandals, you need them to play. And a stick, you need a stick. Two people are throwers. Everyone else stands in between the two throwers. To start the game, the throwers throw the confiscated sandals at the people in the middle, and the first one to get hit is designated the holder. Being holder is a bum job because the holder has to squat there holding a stick upright while flying sandals whistle past your head. Everyone else has to keep dodging sandals, grab the discarded ones, and hang them on the stick that their unfortunate teammate is holding up. If you're hit by a sandal you're out. You win if you hang all the sandals on the stick. The throwers win if they get everyone out before all the sandals are on the stick.

It's called _Kaeng Karp_. Played in villages in southern Laos, here in a happy place called Tad Lo.
