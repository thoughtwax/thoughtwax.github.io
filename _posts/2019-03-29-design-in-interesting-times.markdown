Just realised that I never posted my talk from the [2017 Inside Intercom World Tour](https://www.intercom.com/tour). It's about using system thinking to cope with rapid change, whether that's inside a fast-growing startup, or a world that seems to be going to hell in a handbasket. I gave versions of the talk in New York, Tel Aviv, and finally in San Francisco, which is what's recorded below. Had a ton of fun working with lovely folks from our [Brand Studio](https://brandstudio.intercom.com/) on the visuals for this one.
