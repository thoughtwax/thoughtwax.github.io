*If I should die, God forbid, let this be my epitaph: The only proof he needed for the existence of God was music.* — Kurt Vonnegut

*For me, the Beatles are proof of the existence of God.* — Rick Rubin

*I say in speeches that a plausible mission of artists is to make people appreciate being alive at least a little bit. I am then asked if I know of any artists who pulled that off. I reply, 'The Beatles did'.*  — Kurt Vonnegut

Unless you are a certain type of person, the prospect of an eight hour documentary of restored archival footage of a band rehearsing is an understandably hard sell. Even if the band is The Beatles.

However if you *are* that certain type of person then you immediately binged the entirety of *Get Back* on release day. What a gift. But, you were then perhaps also left in kind of a daze afterwards.

It turns out that listening to an album pretty intently for your entire life (again, you are this type of person in this scenario) and then getting to watch an excruciatingly detailed documentary revealing the entire process of creation is (for you, this type of person) Tutankhamun-level stuff. It’s almost too much information to take in at once. And so, for this wretched creature, even one eight-hour viewing is somehow still not enough.

Nonetheless an eight-hour rewatch remains an intimidating prospect, even for the faithful. Fear not: one bite at a time. The documentary covers the whole month of January 1969, from the band first assembling to kick around new ideas on the 2nd to the complete rooftop concert and conclusion on the 31st. Follow along with this phenonmenal creative achievement in real time for about 30 mins a day.

Also, the days of the week line up in 2025. When it’s the weekend for the Beatles, it’s the weekend for you too.
