It's fun to have had these "state of AI" type chats at different points in the history of this all unfolding. Give me a half-wrong contemporaneous take any day; hindsight is for the low rollers. Previous episodes in what you could now call a series: [June 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8W6YqDsjhg), [August 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYBQzO2u1Xs&t=430s).

I was also on Ridd's mighty [Dive Club](https://www.dive.club/) podcast recently, talking about how the role of design in tech companies is evolving:
