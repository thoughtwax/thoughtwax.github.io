Iâ€™m Emmet Connolly and this is my blog. I live on the west coast of Ireland with [my wife](http://www.paulahenihan.com), two children, dog and cat.

I work as VP of Product Design at [Intercom](http://intercom.io), building the customer service AI Agent of the future.

I previously worked at Google, where I co-founded and launched [Android Wear](http://android.com/wear), and designed the first version of [Google Flight Search](http://google.com/flights). More work on [my portfolio](http://emmetconnolly.com/).

Making digital products fits me well, being an intersection of design, technology, and thinking about new things. I'm from Ireland, but I've lived all over the place (Dublin, New Jersey, Edinburgh, Vancouver, Zurich, San Francisco, and now Dublin and Galway again). I studied Arts in NUI Galway (I.T. and Politics), and a Masters in Digital Art in the University of Plymouth.

You can email me at <emmet.connolly@gmail.com> and I'm [@thoughtwax](http://twitter.com/thoughtwax) on Twitter, although I regreat to say that I check both infrequently. Here's me:
